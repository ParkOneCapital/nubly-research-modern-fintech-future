# The Modern Banking Book: Non-Interest Income:

As fintech reshapes financial services, the traditional banking model is evolving to incorporate both Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) and fintech-enabled offerings. Here, we explore how modern banking operations—impact the  banking book, non-interest income, core systems, and risk management. Our goal is to create a view around the impact of innovation, addressing legacy / risk challenges, and meeting new market demands.

## Non-Interest Income Evolution: 

The financial landscape's rapid evolution, fueled by technological innovation and shifting consumer preferences, amplifies the importance of non-interest income for revenue diversification. Non-interest income (NII) streams, increasingly vital for bank financial sustainability, expansion capital buffers and lowering loan to deposit ratios. Given the adoption of mobile and digital first consumer preferences new solutions are being explored to generate income not exposed to interest rate risk. Pay by Bank, Embedded Finance, as evolutions of payment processing have emerged as transformative drivers, unlocking new avenues for fee-based revenues, transaction fees, and commission-based income, ultimately redefining the reach of traditional banking income diversification splits between NII and Non NII income.

Select Non-interest income streams include:

### Pay By Bank

### Embedded 

By integrating financial services within non-financial platforms, embedded finance allows banks to expand their customer base, especially within underserved segments. This model enhances revenue through partnership fees, transaction volume, and expanded data insights, while creating value-added services for users.

Embedded finance introduces specific risks that could impact a bank's interest income within the banking book, mainly because the nature of embedded finance partnerships and digital service integrations affects both traditional revenue channels and risk management practices. Here are the key risks to interest income in this context:

![Embedded Finance](./assets/embedded_finance.png "Embedded Finance")

#### Interoperability Risk:

Embedded finance partnerships require interoperability between a bank's infrastructure and third-party systems, often relying on modern cloud-based architectures and API integrations. Managing the technology and data flow securely between parties can strain resources and create operational challenges, potentially impacting the bank's ability to grow interest-earning assets efficiently.

The need for increased investment in tech upgrades and integration with third-party systems can reduce funds otherwise allocated toward loan growth, directly affecting interest income.

#### Data Containment and Customer Retention Risks:

Embedded finance ecosystems involve extensive data sharing, which can impact a bank's access to and control over customer relationships. If customers primarily engage with financial services through third-party platforms, the bank may lose direct engagement, limiting cross-selling opportunities for traditional lending products that contribute to interest income.

Furthermore, data containment risks, such as data leaks and privacy issues, could erode customer trust and lead to regulatory fines, both of which might cause customer attrition and a reduction in the volume of interest-earning accounts.

#### Complex Partnership Risks:

Partnering with fintechs and non-banking entities requires banks to navigate complex relationships with varying levels of regulatory and operational sophistication. Without clear governance, banks may be forced to take on higher levels of risk that could eventually impact interest income—especially if the partnership affects the bank’s ability to efficiently manage credit risk and customer acquisition costs.

Complex partnerships might also limit a bank's control over pricing and product terms, which can affect the margins earned on interest-generating products.

#### Credit Risk and Customer Vulnerability:

Embedded finance often involves extending credit products through non-bank platforms, where traditional credit assessment practices may be relaxed or less robust. This can increase the bank's exposure to credit risk, especially when customers are encouraged to take on financing outside of their means.

Serving more vulnerable customer segments without appropriate risk mitigation measures may lead to higher delinquency rates, impacting the bank’s net interest income if defaults increase or if the bank must write down non-performing assets.

#### Distributed Risk in Financial Ecosystems:

Distributed risk across a web of partners creates challenges in tracking and managing exposures. For example, if a partner faces liquidity issues or fails to manage its own risk effectively, this can reverberate through the network, potentially affecting the bank’s income from interest-bearing products.

Additionally, as multiple financial and non-financial entities are involved in each transaction, issues like delayed settlements or higher compliance costs could reduce the efficiency and profitability of interest-earning activities.

In summary, embedded finance’s structural complexity and reliance on third-party partnerships challenge traditional banking models. For a bank's interest income in the banking book, these risks can lead to increased operational costs, weakened customer relationships, higher credit losses, and reduced pricing control—all of which can collectively impact net interest margins. To mitigate these risks, banks need strong risk governance frameworks, advanced data protection measures, and carefully structured partnerships that allow for agile response to evolving risks.

#### Risk Managment of Modern Non-Interest Income

As banking evolves, effective risk management is crucial for sustaining non-interest income growth. Emerging risks necessitate proactive strategies across technological, regulatory, counterparty and operational domains.

Technological risks, such as cybersecurity threats and API vulnerabilities, require robust governance. Regulatory risks, including compliance complexities and licensing requirements, demand timely adaptations. Counterparty risks, like partner solvency and data sharing, necessitate clear agreements.

Operational risks, including process inefficiencies and employee training, require streamlined payment processing and enhanced digital literacy. Legacy system risks, such as integration challenges and data migration complexities, call for scalable infrastructure investments.

Transition and transformation risks, including change management and cultural alignment, demand effective communication and strategic planning.
